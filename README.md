## LLM Adversarial Testing Framework

This repository contains the research and code for **"Testing Guardrail Exposure and Neutralization for Behavioral Regression and Safety of AIML Products."** The framework focuses on methodologies to test, monitor, and enhance guardrail adherence within large language models (LLMs) when subjected to adversarial prompts and high-complexity scenarios.

The research introduces a **multi-tiered testing matrix** to evaluate guardrail resilience across increasing levels of prompt complexity, from baseline interactions to extreme adversarial cases. It combines **Behavioral Adherence Metrics** and **Predictive Analytics** to measure and improve LLM adherence stability, providing actionable insights for reinforcing guardrails against adversarial inputs and ensuring consistent, safe behavior in real-world applications.

Key features include:
- A structured framework for multi-tiered adversarial testing in LLMs
- Mathematical models for adherence monitoring, including metrics like Adherence Score (AS), Exposure Rate (ER), and Boundary Proximity Score (BPS)
- Techniques for identifying guardrail vulnerabilities and critical failure modes under adversarial conditions
- A predictive framework for early detection of adherence drift, allowing for proactive guardrail reinforcement

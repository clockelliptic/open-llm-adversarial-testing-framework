### **Testing and Research Plan**

1. **Baseline and Controlled Testing**:
   - Begin by measuring guardrail adherence under low-complexity prompts to establish a baseline. Identify consistent adherence behaviors that reflect steady-state performance.

2. **Incremental Complexity Testing**:
   - Increase prompt complexity gradually, introducing ambiguity, emotive language, and contextual shifts. Record the model’s adherence and track any progressive erosion of guardrails, identifying tipping points where adherence begins to weaken.

3. **Adversarial and Boundary Pushing Scenarios**:
   - Deploy the automated testing protocol to simulate adversarial inputs at scale. This includes indirect questioning, polite rephrasings, and multi-turn dialogues that test the model’s resilience to neutralization attempts.

4. **Predictive Analysis Validation**:
   - Implement and validate the predictive analysis tools by tracking real-time guardrail adherence across adversarial layering scenarios. Adjust thresholds for the layering progression and boundary proximity indices to capture early signs of potential breaches.

5. **Data Collection for Metric Calibration**:
   - Collect data from each testing phase to refine metric thresholds. Use cross-validation to compare adherence and exposure results across different prompt categories, ensuring metrics reliably capture model weaknesses.

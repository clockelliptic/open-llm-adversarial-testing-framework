To fully quantify the impact of adversarial methods on guardrail adherence in LLMs, we need to define a **mathematical structure** that can represent guardrail behaviors as vectors, assess how adversarial prompts shift these vectors, and finally evaluate the changes using scalar metrics. This expanded framework will clarify the derivation of **guardrail vectors**, show how **adversarial prompts act as opposition vectors**, and demonstrate how to use **scalar metrics** to measure adherence quality in a rigorous way.

---

### **1. Mathematical Definition of Guardrail Vectors**

#### **A. Defining the Guardrail Behavior Space**

1. **Behavioral Dimensions**:
   - Each **dimension** in the guardrail behavior space corresponds to a specific **behavioral component** the model should adhere to. Common dimensions might include:
     - **Compliance**: Represents the model’s adherence to rules (e.g., avoiding inappropriate content).
     - **Politeness/Respectfulness**: Measures the tone stability across interactions.
     - **Consistency**: Reflects the model's ability to avoid contradictions.
     - **Restrictiveness**: Gauges whether the model limits itself to safe topics under sensitive prompts.

2. **Constructing the Behavior Space**:
   - Let \( \mathbb{R}^n \) represent the **n-dimensional behavior space** where each axis \( x_i \) represents a distinct behavior component.
   - The origin \( \mathbf{0} \) represents a hypothetical state of zero adherence to guardrails, while vectors in this space point towards ideal adherence states along each behavior dimension.

#### **B. Guardrail Vectors in Behavior Space**

1. **Individual Guardrail Vectors**:
   - Each guardrail \( G_i \) can be represented by a vector \( \mathbf{G}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n \), which points in the direction of ideal adherence along each relevant behavioral dimension. For instance:
     - **Compliance Guardrail** \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{compliance}} \) might have high values along dimensions representing rule adherence and restrictiveness.
     - **Politeness Guardrail** \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{politeness}} \) would emphasize dimensions associated with tone and sentiment control.

2. **Resultant Guardrail Adherence Vector**:
   - The **total adherence behavior** of the model, combining all guardrails, is represented by the **resultant guardrail adherence vector** \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} \):
     \[
     \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{G}_i
     \]
     where \( N \) is the number of guardrails. This resultant vector is the aggregate of all individual guardrails and points towards the model’s ideal adherence state.

3. **Magnitude and Direction**:
   - The **magnitude** \( \|\mathbf{G}_{\text{total}}\| \) of \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} \) indicates the strength of overall adherence. Larger magnitudes reflect stronger adherence across all guardrails.
   - The **direction** of \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} \) represents the **behavioral orientation** of the LLM, ideally aligned with high adherence across all dimensions.

#### **C. Deriving Guardrail Vectors from Model Training Data**

1. **Training Data and Behavioral Anchors**:
   - Guardrail vectors can be derived by analyzing model responses to non-adversarial, training-set prompts. For each behavioral component, measure ideal response tendencies to establish vector baselines.
   - For example, **politeness** can be evaluated through average sentiment scores, while **compliance** may be assessed by tracking adherence to restricted content guidelines.

2. **Empirical Calibration**:
   - Use empirical data to **calibrate each vector component**. For example, if politeness is quantified by sentiment, calibrate politeness dimensions by measuring average sentiment strength for non-adversarial prompts.
   - This calibration creates a **baseline adherence vector** \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{baseline}} \) that reflects ideal adherence across each behavior component.

### **2. Modeling Adversarial Prompts as Opposition Vectors**

Each adversarial prompt method introduces an **opposition vector** \( \mathbf{O}_m \) that represents how the prompt counters guardrail adherence in specific behavioral dimensions.

#### **A. Types of Opposition Vectors by Adversarial Prompt Method**

1. **Prompt Injection Opposition Vector \( \mathbf{O}_{\text{injection}} \)**:
   - **Definition**: Attempts to directly override guardrail behaviors, often reducing compliance.
   - **Effect on Vector**: Primarily subtracts from the compliance dimension, pulling the model away from rule-following behavior.
   - **Mathematical Representation**:
     \[
     \mathbf{O}_{\text{injection}} = (-\Delta_{\text{compliance}}, 0, 0, \dots, 0)
     \]
     where \( \Delta_{\text{compliance}} \) is the reduction in compliance strength.

2. **Ambiguity Manipulation Opposition Vector \( \mathbf{O}_{\text{ambiguity}} \)**:
   - **Definition**: Increases the potential for contradictory or inconsistent responses by introducing vague prompts.
   - **Effect on Vector**: Pulls the adherence vector away from consistency.
   - **Mathematical Representation**:
     \[
     \mathbf{O}_{\text{ambiguity}} = (0, 0, -\Delta_{\text{consistency}}, 0, \dots, 0)
     \]
     where \( \Delta_{\text{consistency}} \) measures the effect on the model’s consistency in responses.

3. **Waluigi Effect Opposition Vector \( \mathbf{O}_{\text{Waluigi}} \)**:
   - **Definition**: Pushes the model into antagonistic or oppositional behaviors.
   - **Effect on Vector**: Strong reduction in politeness and compliance.
   - **Mathematical Representation**:
     \[
     \mathbf{O}_{\text{Waluigi}} = (-\Delta_{\text{compliance}}, -\Delta_{\text{politeness}}, 0, \dots, 0)
     \]

#### **B. Cumulative Adversarial Effect**

As adversarial prompts accumulate, the total opposition to adherence becomes:
\[
\mathbf{O}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{O}_m
\]
where \( M \) is the number of adversarial prompts. The **shifted adherence vector** is:
\[
\mathbf{G}_{\text{shifted}} = \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} + \mathbf{O}_{\text{total}}
\]
This shifted vector represents the new adherence state, affected by adversarial influences.

#### **C. Angle of Deviation and Guardrail Integrity**

To quantify adherence loss, calculate the **angle \( \theta \)** between \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} \) and \( \mathbf{G}_{\text{shifted}} \):
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{G}_{\text{total}} \cdot \mathbf{G}_{\text{shifted}}}{\|\mathbf{G}_{\text{total}}\| \|\mathbf{G}_{\text{shifted}}\|}
\]
A larger angle \( \theta \) suggests greater erosion of adherence, with a 90° or larger angle indicating significant deviation from baseline behavior.

---

### **3. Quantifying Guardrail Neutralization with Metrical Scores**

While the vector model describes behavioral shifts, **scalar metrics** such as Adherence Score (AS), Exposure Rate (ER), and Antagonistic Response Index (ARI) provide quantifiable adherence measures. These metrics assess the practical impact of vector shifts.

#### **A. Calculating Metric Changes as Drift Quantification**

1. **Adherence Score (AS)**: Measures the strength of adherence to guardrails.
   - **Change Calculation**:
     \[
     \Delta \text{AS} = \text{AS}_{\text{baseline}} - \text{AS}_{\text{shifted}}
     \]
   - A larger \( \Delta \text{AS} \) suggests more adherence loss due to opposition vectors.

2. **Exposure Rate (ER)**: Tracks how often boundaries are breached under adversarial influence.
   - **Change Calculation**:
     \[
     \Delta \text{ER} = \text{ER}_{\text{shifted}} - \text{ER}_{\text{baseline}}
     \]
   - Significant \( \Delta \text{ER} \) indicates frequent boundary breaches, signaling guardrail failure.

3. **Antagonistic Response Index (ARI)**: Measures frequency of hostile or non-compliant responses.
   - **Change Calculation**:
     \[
     \Delta \text{ARI} = \text{ARI}_{\text{shifted}} - \text{ARI}_{\text{baseline}}
     \]
   - A high \( \Delta \text{ARI} \) signals that the model frequently produces antagonistic responses, showing guardrail erosion.

#### **B. Thresholds for Functional Neutralization**

Define metric-based thresholds that indicate when guardrails are functionally neutralized:
   - **Neutralization Threshold for AS**: e.g., AS falls below 50%.
   - **Critical Exposure Rate (ER)**: e.g., ER exceeds a certain value, indicating frequent breaches.
   - **High ARI**: e.g., ARI exceeds a threshold, showing frequent hostile outputs.

### **4

. Iterative Guardrail Calibration**

Use the **observed vector shifts** and **scalar metric thresholds** to adjust guardrails:
1. **Reinforce Weak Dimensions**: Adjust guardrail vectors \( \mathbf{G}_i \) for components with high drift (e.g., politeness if \( \mathbf{O}_{\text{Waluigi}} \) impacts it heavily).
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Modify scalar metric thresholds for sensitive areas (e.g., lower AS threshold if compliance weakens).

---

### **Conclusion**

This framework allows us to view guardrails as directional behavioral goals in a high-dimensional space and quantify how adversarial prompts shift adherence. By deriving opposition vectors for each prompt method, measuring angular deviation in behavior space, and using scalar metrics to track adherence quality, we obtain a comprehensive method for understanding and improving LLM guardrail resilience.
